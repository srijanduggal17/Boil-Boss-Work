# Boil-Boss-Work

Promo Video
  - My task was to take the Original Video and make the temperature readout look nicer.
  - I started by taking one of the frames and making a new background. I put "Original timer.png" into paint.net and created a white mask that I could overlay on top of the entire video and would leave everything looking clean. The final image is called "White full mask.png".
  - Then I needed to create the actual frames with the timer and the temperatures.
  - In the "Time Sequence Script" folder, there are two data files: "Boilbossdata.csv" and "Regulardata.csv". These have the temperatures for every second.
  - In the script itself, I read these two files and combine them with a timer to create each frame for the video.
  - The final frames are in the "Frames" folder, with the exception of the two highlighted moments, which are saved as "Pauseframe1red.png" and "Pauseframe2red.png".
